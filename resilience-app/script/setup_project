  Usage:
     setup_project <new_project_name> <existing_project_directory>

  Example:
     setup_project MyAndroidApp /Users/pivotal/workspace/my-android-app
     
     This command will copy all of the starter project's files to
     your my-android-app directory, rename the IntelliJ project to
     be MyAndroidApp, commit the new files to your project repo, and
     add robolectric as a git submodule to your project directory.
     It assumes that your project directory is already a git repo.
